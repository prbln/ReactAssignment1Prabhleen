Assignment for today:
1. In Login view, use reqres.in/api/login to post the username and password in the required format. If you get a success response from the API, only then run the onLoginSuccess function.
2. In Projects view, use reqres.in/api/users to fetch the users list when the component mounts (use the useEffect hook  here). Then update that response to a state variable (use the useState hook here) and display it in the cards that we created yesterday.
3. Convert regular html elements to reactstrap components
